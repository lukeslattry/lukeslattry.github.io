						<strong>West Cork Coffee </strong>
						<br/>
						<i>Identity Design</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						With a focus on quality and doing things the right way, West Cork Coffee's mission was one I couldn't but resinate with.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based in Innishannon, Co. Cork, West Cork Coffee has been roasting some of the finest coffee in the land the time had come to step up it's branding game.
					</p>
					<p>
						Working with Tony, Founder and Head Roaster at West Cork Coffee, I designed a simple, scalable and memorable logo that would be come the centre piece all of West Cork Coffee's branding and packaging.
					</p>
					<p>
						Capturing the personality of both Tony and the business was essential. The WCC logo would grow to mean more than just a coffee brand, but become a symbol for values that West Cork Coffee holds at it's core.
					</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom:40px;">
						The identity grew from that logo and my work with West Cork Coffee continues as we explore more exciting and fun ideas to grow the brand.
